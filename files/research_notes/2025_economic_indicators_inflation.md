# 2025 Economic Indicators and Inflation Research

## Key Economic Indicators

GDP growth in 2025 showed resilience, with the US economy expanding at approximately 2.3% annually. This moderate growth reflected a soft landing scenario, avoiding recession while maintaining price stability.

Unemployment remained historically low at 3.8-4.1%, demonstrating labor market strength despite Federal Reserve tightening. Job creation averaged 180,000 monthly, with services and healthcare leading employment gains.

Consumer confidence rebounded significantly, reaching 110-115 on the Conference Board index, as inflation pressures eased and wage growth outpaced price increases for the first time in three years.

## Inflation Trends

Headline inflation declined to 2.4% by year-end 2025, down from 3.2% in early 2025. Core inflation (excluding food and energy) stabilized at 2.6%, approaching but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

Housing inflation, a major component of CPI, showed signs of cooling as rent growth normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Goods inflation turned negative in some categories due to supply chain normalization and increased competition.
