# 2025 Interest Rate Changes and Monetary Policy Research

## Federal Reserve Policy

The Federal Reserve implemented a measured easing cycle in 2025, cutting the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to a range of 4.25-4.50%. This represented a shift from the restrictive stance of 2024 as inflation showed sustained improvement.

The Fed paused rate cuts mid-year to assess economic conditions, maintaining rates through summer before resuming gradual easing in Q4. This cautious approach reflected concerns about inflation persistence and labor market tightness.

Quantitative tightening continued through most of 2025, with the Fed reducing its balance sheet by $60 billion monthly until September, when it announced plans to slow the runoff pace.

## Global Central Bank Actions

European Central Bank cut rates more aggressively, reducing its deposit rate from 4.0% to 2.5% as Eurozone growth stagnated. The Bank of England lowered rates to 4.25% from 5.25% amid cooling inflation.

Bank of Japan began its long-anticipated tightening cycle, raising rates from -0.1% to 0.25% as inflation sustainably exceeded its 2% target. This marked a historic shift away from ultra-loose monetary policy.
