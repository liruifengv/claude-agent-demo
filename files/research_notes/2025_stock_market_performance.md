AI-related companies saw exceptional returns, with major players like NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Google parent Alphabet posting gains exceeding 30%. The "Magnificent 7" tech stocks continued to dominate market capitalization.

Market volatility remained relatively low despite geopolitical tensions, with the VIX averaging below 20 for most of the year. This stability was attributed to strong corporate earnings and resilient economic data.
