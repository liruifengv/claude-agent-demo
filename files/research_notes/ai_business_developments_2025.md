## Funding Overview

2025 has been a record-breaking year for AI investment, with venture capitalists pouring $192.7 billion into AI startups—representing 52.5% of total venture capital investment globally ($366.8 billion). This marks the first year where more than half of total VC dollars went to AI. Global VC investment rose from $112 billion in Q2'25 to $120 billion in Q3'25, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of $100 billion+ investment. In the first half of 2025, funding to AI startups totaled $116 billion, exceeding the entire investment total for 2024.

## Largest Funding Rounds

Anthropic announced a $13 billion Series F round in September, valued at $183 billion, led by Iconiq, Fidelity, and Lightspeed.
