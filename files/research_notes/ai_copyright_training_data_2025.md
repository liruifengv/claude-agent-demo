# AI Copyright and Training Data Regulations 2025

The US Copyright Office released a pivotal 108-page report on May 9, 2025, analyzing whether unauthorized use of copyrighted materials to train generative AI constitutes fair use. The report concluded that using copyrighted works to train AI models may constitute prima facie infringement of reproduction rights, and that while GenAI training on large, diverse datasets "will often be transformative," using copyrighted material alone is insufficient to justify fair use. This guidance provides essential clarity for AI companies navigating legal risks around training datasets.

The EU AI Act provisions taking effect August 2, 2025 require general-purpose AI providers to disclose copyrighted material used in training and commit to transparency about data sources. The UK prohibits commercial data mining but proposed changes to support AI development with lawful access requirements. Significant court precedent emerged in 2025, including Thomson Reuters v. Ross Intelligence (copying Westlaw headnotes failed fair use), but also favorable rulings where judges found that training large language models on copyrighted books—even when legally obtained—constituted "exceedingly transformative" fair use.

Global regulatory approaches diverge: the US emphasizes fair use doctrine with copyright office guidance, the EU requires transparency and may restrict certain uses through regulation, and the UK is reforming data mining restrictions. The central unresolved tension remains whether large-scale AI training on diverse copyrighted datasets constitutes transformative fair use or requires licensing agreements with rights holders.
