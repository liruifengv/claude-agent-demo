# AI in Finance 2025

## Adoption and Implementation

85% of financial institutions have integrated AI into operations by 2025, up from 45% in 2022. However, a gap persists: while 85% of CFOs express optimism about AI efficiency gains, only 39% of finance teams have implemented AI into workflows. Eight in 10 CFOs say they direct AI promotion or implementation efforts, yet fewer than half feel fully ready for adoption. The finance AI market was valued at $9.45 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow 16.5% by 2030.

## Key Applications

AI transforms financial close timelines: an August 2025 MIT/Stanford study found AI reduces monthly financial close time by 7.5 days, and AI-using accountants support 55% more clients weekly compared to non-users. AI revolutionizes real-time budgeting and forecasting by integrating live market data instead of static quarterly updates. Credit risk assessment leverages real-time data integration with historical records, analyzing payment history, industry trends, and geopolitical factors for dynamic risk scores. Additional applications include fraud detection, portfolio management, compliance automation, and customer service enhancement.
