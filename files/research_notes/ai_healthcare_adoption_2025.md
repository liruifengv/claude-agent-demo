Healthcare remains below average in AI adoption compared to other industries, indicating significant growth potential.

## Key Applications

Ambient clinical documentation powered by generative AI is the most universally adopted use case, with 100% of healthcare systems reporting usage. One major California health system saved nearly 16,000 hours in documentation time over 15 months using ambient AI. Average ROI is substantial at $3.20 for every $1 invested, with typical returns realized within 14 months. Healthcare organizations are accelerating buying cycles from 12-18 months down to under 6 months, showing increased urgency around AI adoption.
