# AI Safety and Governance Initiatives 2025

Global AI safety initiatives in 2025 emphasized international cooperation, institutional standards-building, and regional approaches to governance. The 2025 World AI Conference in Shanghai (July 2025) published a Global AI Governance Action Plan, while the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris (February 2025) brought together political, business, and civil society leaders to foster cooperation on AI governance, innovation, and safety. The AI Safety Index collected evidence through November 8, 2025, surveying major AI companies (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, xAI, Z.ai) on governance structures and safety practices.

Key governance innovations emerging in 2025 include structural models that embed safety into fiduciary duties—such as Public Benefit Corporation status and capped-profit models—that legally constrain short-term financial pressures. The UK pivoted its AI Safety Institute to the "AI Security Institute" in February 2025, narrowing focus from broader safety concerns to immediate security priorities. Singapore launched a Global AI Assurance Pilot as a technical testing testbed for generative AI applications, emphasizing regional approaches to governance.

The Oxford Martin AI Governance Initiative challenged the assumption that AI requires entirely new regulatory architecture, arguing that existing global institutions and safety standards from aviation, energy, and finance sectors can be adapted for AI governance. This reflects a growing consensus that proportionate, standards-based regulation built on proven frameworks may be more effective than novel regulatory structures for managing AI risks.
