# China AI Regulations and Governance 2025

China implemented comprehensive AI-generated content labeling requirements in 2025, with the Measures for Labeling AI-Generated Content and national standard GB 45438-2025 taking effect September 1, 2025. These mandatory regulations require all online services creating or distributing AI-generated content to clearly label such material. New national standards for generative AI security and governance, released in April 2025, became effective November 1, 2025, establishing baseline security protocols for AI systems.

Major cybersecurity law amendments passed October 28, 2025 (effective January 1, 2026) represent the first significant update to China's 2016 Cybersecurity Law and indicate tightening oversight of digital technologies including AI. Simultaneously, China pursued international leadership through a Global AI Governance Action Plan announced by Premier Li Qiang at the 2025 World AI Conference (July 2025), proposing a 13-point roadmap for global AI coordination. President Xi Jinping advocated for establishing a World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization (WAICO) at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in October 2025.

China's regulatory approach balances development incentives with state control through labeling requirements, security standards, and content governance, while positioning the country as a global leader in international AI governance frameworks. The national standards emphasize security, content verification, and risk management for generative AI systems deployed across the economy.
