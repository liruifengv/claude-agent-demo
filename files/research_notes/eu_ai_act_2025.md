# EU AI Act Regulations 2025

The EU AI Act is rolling out in phases throughout 2025, with critical compliance deadlines affecting organizations operating in Europe. Phase 1 began February 2, 2025, prohibiting high-risk AI practices including manipulation, social scoring, and emotion inference in workplace/education settings. Phase 2 on August 2, 2025 introduced governance rules and obligations for general-purpose AI (GPAI) models, requiring transparency, technical documentation, and disclosure of copyrighted training data.

Key compliance requirements for GPAI providers include detailed technical documentation, transparency measures for AI-generated content, and disclosure of training data sources—particularly regarding copyright material usage. The European AI Office and Member State authorities oversee enforcement, with first enforcement actions expected in late 2025. By August 2, 2026, the full AI Act becomes applicable for most AI systems, though high-risk systems in regulated products have extended compliance until August 2, 2027.

The European Commission proposed simplification measures in November 2025 to ensure proportionate implementation of certain provisions. Organizations must establish compliance frameworks covering prohibited practices, documentation requirements, and transparency obligations across all product deployments in EU markets.
