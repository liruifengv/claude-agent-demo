# Government Funding for AI Research 2025

US federal AI research funding remains substantial but faces uncertainty with administrative changes. For fiscal 2025, top-level agency allocations are: NSF ($494 million core AI funding), DARPA ($314 million), NIH ($309 million), DoD ($233 million), DOE ($187 million), and USDA ($104 million). NSF received the largest funding increase (+$285 million over FY24) with primary growth in AI research, growing from $400 million to $494 million. Broader agency budgets remain significant: DARPA at $1.41 billion and Department of Energy at $1.54 billion for FY25.

NSF-led National AI Research Institutes requested $72.3 million for FY 2025, including contributions from NSF, DoD, Department of Education, NIST, and USDA. However, the Trump administration's budget proposals and recent policy decisions signal potential challenges for research funding. In October 2025, the federal government cut funding for a program dedicated to using AI for weather prediction, and the administration proposes reducing NSF's budget by over half, indicating significant uncertainty for sustained AI research investment.

Despite current funding levels, structural pressures and policy shifts in 2025 suggest declining support for long-term AI research projects. The gap between EU government research commitments and US federal funding, combined with private sector dominance of AI development, may shift the balance of research innovation toward commercial entities rather than government-sponsored fundamental research.
