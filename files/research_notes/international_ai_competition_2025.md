# International AI Cooperation and Competition 2025

International AI competition intensified in 2025 through major conferences, student competitions, and divergent regulatory models. The 2025 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai (July 2025) attracted over 800 exhibitors and 3,000+ exhibits, showcasing China's technological prowess with themes on academic breakthroughs, software-hardware integration, and global governance. The second International Olympiad on Artificial Intelligence (IOAI) concluded in August 2025 in Beijing, reflecting global youth engagement in AI development. The World Artificial Intelligence Competition for Youth (WAICY) positioned itself as the world's largest student competition in AI, emphasizing educational leadership.

China pursued international governance leadership through Premier Li Qiang's announcement of a Global AI Governance Action Plan (July 2025) proposing a 13-point roadmap for international AI coordination. President Xi Jinping advocated for establishing a World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization (WAICO) in October 2025 at APEC, positioning China as a governance leader. Meanwhile, the United Nations University launched the AI for SDGs Global Youth AI Future Innovation Competition 2025, focusing on environmental and sustainability challenges.

Regional and philosophical divides characterize 2025 AI competition: Europe emphasizes regulatory governance through the AI Act, the US prioritizes innovation with flexible regulation and export controls, and China combines technological leadership with state control and international governance proposals. This triad reflects fundamentally different approaches to AI development, with cooperation limited to student-level initiatives and climate/SDG applications rather than strategic technology sharing among major powers.
