# US AI Policy and Regulations 2025

The US AI regulatory landscape shifted dramatically in 2025 with the change in presidential administrations. Trump's Executive Order on AI (January 2025) rescinded Biden's safer AI framework and prioritized deregulation and competitive advantage. Biden's final policies required companies to report on powerful AI systems before public release and implemented export controls to limit foreign access to advanced AI technology through Commerce Department regulations finalized in January 2025.

Trump's National AI Action Plan (July 2025) focuses on removing regulatory barriers, accelerating infrastructure development through streamlined permitting, and emphasizing public-private partnerships. The administration explicitly rescinds policies deemed "inconsistent" with enhancing US AI dominance, marking a fundamental shift toward industry-driven growth over safety-first regulation. The Department of Commerce rescinded Biden-era AI diffusion rules designed to support AI accessibility across economic sectors.

Currently, the US lacks comprehensive federal legislation specifically regulating AI development or restricting its use. Regulations operate through sectoral frameworks (healthcare, finance) and export controls rather than horizontal AI regulation like the EU model. This represents a continued commitment to market-led innovation with targeted oversight through security and export mechanisms rather than broad governance requirements.
