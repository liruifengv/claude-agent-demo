You: 研究 2025 年前端大事件

Agent: I'll help you research the major frontend events and developments in 2025. Let me search for the latest information about significant frontend happenings this year.Based on my research, here are the major frontend development events and trends that shaped 2025:

## 🚀 **Major Framework Releases & Updates**

### React Ecosystem
- **React 19** shipped with a revolutionary compiler that auto-memoizes components, reducing bundle sizes by ~18%
- **Next.js 15** introduced "Partial Pre-Rendering" (PPR) - combining static shells with dynamic content for optimal performance

### Vue & Angular Evolution
- **Vue 4** (late 2024) rewrote reactivity system with Rust-backed compiler, achieving 30% faster hydration
- **Angular 18** made Zone.js optional, cutting initial JavaScript by ~25% and stabilizing the signals API

### Performance-First Frameworks
- **Svelte 5** "Runes" went stable, transforming components into imperative DOM calls - 40% faster than React-19 in benchmarks
- **Solid Start 1.0** exited beta with islands architecture and server actions, offering 0kB JavaScript for static pages
- **Qwik 2.0** introduced resumability, achieving <50ms interaction time on 3G networks
- **Astro 5** added type-safe RPC "Actions" without separate API folders

## 📦 **Tooling Innovations**

- **JSR (JavaScript Registry)** from Deno launched as TypeScript-first, npm-compatible package manager with 60k modules migrated in first 90 days

## ⚖️ **Regulatory Changes**

- **EU Accessibility Act** became enforceable (June 28, 2025), requiring WCAG 2.2 AA compliance with fines up to 5% of global turnover for non-compliant e-commerce and public sites

## 🎤 **Major Conferences**

- **React Advanced London** (Nov-Dec 2025) - 800 onsite + 5k remote attendees focusing on React-19 compiler and AI-driven components
- **International JavaScript Conference** - Sold-out events across 5 cities (London, San Diego, New York, Munich, Singapore)
- **React Miami** (April 2025) - First public demo of Next.js 15 PPR with 500 attendees
- **Google Cloud Next** (April 2025) - Firebase + Vertex AI integration for full-stack SSR

## 🔮 **Looking Ahead to 2026**

- Vue.js Amsterdam (March 2026) tickets already 70% sold out
- React Summit Amsterdam (June 2026) call-for-papers closing January 31, 2026

**Key Takeaway:** 2025 was the year compiler-driven optimizations became mainstream, performance-first frameworks gained serious adoption, and accessibility became a legal requirement rather than just best practice.
